[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kaizendorks/vue-cli-plugin-vuedock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kaizendorks/vue-cli-plugin-vuedock)

A plugin for the awesome [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) that generates the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) files necessary for both development and production.
::: tip
You can install from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-cli-plugin-vuedock) using the Vue CLI:
```bash
vue add vuedock
```
:::

The plugin will add a `Dockerfile` to your web application that uses [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) so you don't need separated Dockerfiles for development and production.
- When building the **development** stage, all dependencies are installed into a Node image with `npm run serve` as its default command.
- When building the **production** stage, an NGINX image is used, including _only static files_ previously generated by `npm run build`.

Development is further simplified by generating a `docker-compose.yml` file:
- You can start your development server with hot-reload using `docker-compose up app`
- You can run linting and tests using similar commands, such as `docker-compose run --rm app npm run test:unit`
- If e2e tests are available in your project, it will also add support for running them, including a Selenium container for Nightwatch E2E tests!

::: tip
The plugin will automatically detect whether your project is using **npm** or **yarn**, and adapt the generated files accordingly.
