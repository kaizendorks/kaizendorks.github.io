## Kubernetes for Developers

Getting started with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is hard. And the first problem you will have to solve is to navigate all the resources and courses available online!

We have created the tutorial we wish we had when we first started with Kubernetes. It is based on our learning experience, curating resources from various sources such as the official Kubernetes website and online [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) courses.
