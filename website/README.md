Kaizen Dorks Dublin is the result of putting together *kaizen* (japanese word for improvement) and *dork* (dublin slang for a beautiful and likeable nerd) by a group of IT professionals aiming to improve themselves.

This site showcases the work we have done in areas of our interest, motivated out of curiosity and a desire to learn. As a result, we have published a number of [projects](/projects/) across npm, PyPI or Docker Hub, as well as in-depth [tutorials](/tutorials/) and [articles](/blog/)!
